# Steps
1. Create a new Github repository using your own account

2. Find and report as many bugs for this [website](https://hzhcongo.github.io/ToDo/ToDo.html), via your created repository's Issues. The website contains a to-do feature that allows one to manage a to-do list. Bugs can be UI / UX / function / technical / security related. Each bug reported should contain the following, as comprehensively as possible (see sample [here](https://github.com/hzhcongo/hzhcongo.github.io/issues)):
  - Expected behaviour
  - Actual behaviour
  - Steps to replicate
  - Severity, and why
  - Priority, and why

3. Share with us your Github Repository Issue link
